TOP Project Landing Page

This is the final chapter of the HTML and CSS pathway in the Foundations section of The Odin Project.

Here everything we've learned regarding flexbox, margin, padding, aligning etc. should be coming together.

Project start date: 25th of January 2022

Project finish on the 26th of January

All in all this was a good way to see what stuck. I am happy to say I didn't really face any major issues setting it up and it was mostly a smooth ride. I first drew a couple of boxes around the TOP design to plan out my containers or blocks of content. I added a preview of that in the Ref Downloads folder. 

Then I went section by section.
The only 2 things I fiddled with were my hero image stretching at smaller sizes. That was fixed when I set an alignment to center.
And I couldn't quite get the Thor signature where I wanted it but part of that issue was forgetting to save and forgetting this was in flex-direction column.

Great project to test some flexbox skills and now very ready to get back into JavaScript.
